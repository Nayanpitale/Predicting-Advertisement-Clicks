# Advertisement Click Prediction Project

This repository contains the code and documentation for a project focused on predicting whether or not a particular internet user clicked on an advertisement on a company website.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to develop a machine learning model that can accurately predicts whether a user will click on an advertisement based on various features such as age, gender, time spent on the website, etc. This prediction can be valuable for targeted advertising campaigns and optimizing marketing strategies.

## Files

- `advertisement_click_prediction.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the code for data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, model training, and evaluation.
- `documentation.pdf`: PDF file providing detailed documentation of the project, including dataset description, methodology, results, and conclusions.
